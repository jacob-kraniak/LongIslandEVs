**Promoting Electric Vehicle Adoption on Long Island and Metro New York**

LongIslandEVs is a community-focused initiative dedicated to sharing electric vehicle (EV) news, ownership experiences, charging infrastructure updates, and practical insights for residents of Long Island and the greater Metro New York area. Closely aligned with the [Drive Electric Long Island](https://driveelectriclongisland.org/) coalition, this project supports advocacy, education, and outreach to accelerate EV adoption, improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lower transportation costs, and enhance grid resilience.

## Mission
